# class_db
A simple skeleton code in C for a database

TO DO LIST :

Do the makefile
● Start doing structures for table and rows (for rows you can define
one struct and use it, and not use user input)
● Implement the select statement
● Implement the Insert statement 

Provide some tests (assert for now)
● Keep track on where you are in the DB should you need it
● Store everything in a binary tree and develop the major things
you’ll need (balancing/splitting/searching/inserting/deleting and
other if you have ideas)
● Do some disk persistence
