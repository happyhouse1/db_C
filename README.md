# db_C

# steps 1

● Do the makefile 
● Start doing structures for table and rows (for rows you can define 
one struct and use it, and not use user input)
● Implement the select statement 
● Implement the Insert statement

# steps 2

● Provide some tests (assert for now)
● Keep track on where you are in the DB should you need it 
● Store everything in a binary tree and develop the major things 
you’ll need (balancing/splitting/searching/inserting/deleting and 
other if you have ideas)
● Do some disk persistence

# General idea

● The most important things for me are
– Working binary tree, and some sql commands (insert/delete/select)
– Disk persistence is quite easy and should not be too hard
